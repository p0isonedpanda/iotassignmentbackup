# iotassignmentbackup
just a backup if our other attempts don't pan out as we hope for this assignment. my goal was to make it as light as possible with whatever i know or can find out, so i did away with any web frameworks like node or django and just went with what you can see here now. the purpose is to allow for a full stack of communication from a front end webstie, to a database, to an arduino, and then back up that chain again if need be.
